27,PMC4145444,S28,Vitamin D in addition to treatment with calcium carbonate as limestone facilitates more rapid healing of rickets in children with calcium-deficiency rickets.The response to treatment with vitamin D and calcium was independent of baseline 25(OH)D concentrations.A greater increase in serum 25(OH)D concentration over the course of treatment was predictive of successful healing of rickets.,2585,2973,[],['0'],Abstract,['0']
